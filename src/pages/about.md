Hi, I'm PJ. I'm a writer, software engineer and general fettler of all things
electronic and software. Originally from Liverpool but now in the futuristic
city of Milton Keynes.

I have a special affinity for Raspberry Pi and a regular
contributor for [The MagPi](https://magpi.raspberrypi.com/). I can also be found at The National Museum of Computing
tinkering with ZX Spectrums or running the films at [Electromagnetic Field](https://emfcamp.org).

You can get in touch on Mastodon.
