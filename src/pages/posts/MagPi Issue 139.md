[The MagPi issue 139](https://magpi.raspberrypi.com/issues/139) is now available, specially release to coincide with Raspberry Pi's third birthday. (That's right, third, Raspberry Pi is a leap-year baby!)

I've been busy in this one. Firstly the cover feature is a beginner's all-purpose troubleshooting guide. A lot of the stuff covered seems basic, but that's because we know it. There was a time we didn't and thats the sort of up-and-coming one-day-soon-experts this is for. Everything from powering on to diagnosing audio issues and your first GPIO hook-up. I'm hoping it saves someone out there some time and frustration.

That's not all! In the tutorials section you can find the first of a two-parter on upcycling Sonos speakers. A while ago the S1/S2 debacle caused my Sonos Play:1 speaker to become less useful and recently I decided I wanted something that could play ambient music just by pushing a button. So, some mangling with a Torx screwdriver later and I had a Raspberry Pi 3A installed running both AirPlay (for Apple device streaming) and a custom script to stream channels from the excellent [SomaFM](https://somafm.com). Part one details how to get inside the Sonos player and install some Raspberry Pi hardware. It can, of course, be applied to any audio device such as a vintage radio. Part two will cover the software side of things.
